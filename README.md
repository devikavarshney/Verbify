# Verbify
An app for helping mute people to communicate by converting sign languages to voice-over calls. 
#Problem  
[1]People with disabilities have difficulty communicating with the world as they face problems with audio or video calls. 
[2]This also leads to a communication gap and a lack of interaction between the people who can not speak with the world. 
[3]Considering the fact that communication is key for appropriate representation in a community, physically challenged people are at a disadvantage because they feel isolated and helpless. 
[4]Some individuals rely on translators to get the job done, but this may not be the case if people do not always have access to a translator. 
#Proposed Solution  
We wish to implement a prototype that analyses the video in online video calls and detects sign language when it is being used. The signs are then converted to audio for everyone else in the meeting to be able to communicate with ease, without any lag or communication gaps. In the future, our prototype will also integrate with the audio calls through the phone and will interpret the sign language and convert them to voice.
